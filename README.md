This directory has the code needed to replicate the results in
"The impact of current and future climates on spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza in a tropical setting" by Mahmud et al.
* `code/` - has the code used in the analysis
* `data/` - this is where the data should be downloaded and saved
* `out/`  -  where the results of the scripts get saved 

To replicate our results and run the scripts you will need to get the following data:

* Influenza surveillance data from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Bangladesh which can be downloaded from [here](https://iedcr.gov.bd/surveillances/890e910b-665f-4f9a-a0d9-1db2e8d73a60).

* Specific humidity and temperature data from the ERA5 gridded hourly dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)

* Precipitation data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) gridded monthly dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/)

* Population data from WorldPop which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.worldpop.org/datacatalog/)
